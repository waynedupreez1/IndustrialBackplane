I keep most projects hosted in public repositories: <a href="http://github.com/frankv"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> Github</a> &nbsp; <a href="http://bitbucket.org/frankv"><i class="fa fa-bitbucket"></i> Bitbucket</a>.
&nbsp; Still there are a few pet projects I don't do enough to warrant the repo or they're so poorly
written I'd be too ashamed to share publicly.

I've collected and written about a few things I'm most proud of. <br>
You'll find them in my "**Cool Stuff**".
